# Digital whiteboard app for Aluminum Associates

The plan? Simple. We're gonna build a whiteboard app using a bunch of React crap because why not?

### Uses:

- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd)
- [google-sheets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet)
- [@chakra-ui/core](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started)

### Plan of attack:

- Use Next JS as an SSG for a single page app
- Google Sheets for an approachable "database" for staff
- react-beautiful-dnd to build a rearrangable list for products
